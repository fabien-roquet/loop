# fluidloop, version 1
Thermohaline loop, written in Fortran.
Instructions to test the fluidloop program (version 1)

## Motivation

The thermohaline loop model consists of a fluid loop with infinitesimal section area along which a circulation is induced by applying fluxes of temperature and salt and/or by directly applying a torque.
The thermohaline model can serve as a conceptual model of the global ocean overturning circulation. It does not only find application in physical oceanography but
also in nuclear and solar energy engineering in the form of the so-called thermosyphons. 
Despite its simple setup, the thermohaline loop exhibits a variety of dynamical behaviors including instability and chaos. 
Apart from being interesting in its own right, the loop model has great educational value when it comes to the analysis of overturning flows. 

More information on the model equations can be found in the following publications:

## Installation


1. copy fluidloop.f90 in your working directory. In a Bash terminal, get in the loop directory, then:

    ```
    WORKDIR=my_working_directory
    cp fluiloop.f90 $WORKDIR
    cd $WORKDIR
    ```
    
2. compile it. For example, if your fortran compiler is gfortran, execute

    ```
    gfortran fluidloop.f90 -o fluidloop.exe
    ```
    
3. execute the fluidloop program

    ```
    ./fluidloop.exe
    ```
    
    Important: If output files already exists in your working directory, the program will stop. Rename or remove them before running the loop program.
    
4. check that the output files are identical to reference outputs:

    ```
    diff TEST_config.txt TEST_config.txt_ref
    diff TEST_out_0D.txt TEST_out_0D.txt_ref
    diff TEST_out_1D.txt TEST_out_1D.txt_ref
    ```
    
If you did not find any difference, it means that the program works fine.


## Output files

Three output files are created in the working directory, whose prefix `$EXP` is set by the `name_exp` entry in the `namrun` section of the namelist:

  1. `$EXP_config.txt` outputs the loop configuration, including namelist parameters and loop geometry factors
  
  2. `$EXP_out_0D.txt` provides snapshots of basic 0D properties of the loop at a frequency set by the `niter_write_0D` entry in the `namrun` section of the namelist:
    * niter
    * time
    * velocity
    * mass
    
  3. `$EXP_out_1D.txt` provides snapshots of basic 1D properties of the loop at a frequency set by the `niter_write_1D` entry in the `namrun` section of the namelist
    * niter: number of iteration
    * j: loop index (varies from 1 to nl)
    * theta: temperature
    * salt: salinity
    * sigma: density
    
Note that the program execution will fail if the output files already exist.


## Configuration files

  1. The namelist is the configuration file that allows to configure the loop model. The structure of the namelist must be as follows:
  
    ```
    &namrun
      name_exp   = 'TEST'               ! name of experiment (used to name outputs). file max characters: 50
      nl = 360                         	! number of points around loop
      niter_t1 = 10000                  ! number of iterations at t=1
      niter_max = 10000  		  	      ! maximum number of timesteps
      niter_write_0D = 10000            ! number of iterations between writing output of output_0D
      niter_write_1D = 10000            ! number of iterations between writing output of output_1D
      init_from_file = .TRUE.           ! start from init_state (T) or from rest (F)
      init_state = 'init_state.txt'     ! initial state for temperature, salinity and velocity. max characters: 50
    /

    &namconfig
      Zf = 0.5               	  	      ! height of source and sink of buoyancy -1<Zf<1
      R = 0.1                           ! inverse Rayleigh number
      lambda = 0.                     	! cabbeling parameter
      mu = 0.                           ! thermobaric parameter
      foldtrue = .TRUE.               	! Is the loop folded or not
    /

    &namforcing
      tau   = 0.                		    ! applied torque
      ref_t = 5.             	  	      ! Reference toward which temperature is relaxed
      xi_t  = 1.                        ! Temperature relaxation parameter
      F_s   = 0.15              	  	  ! Strength of fixed salinity forcing
    /
    ```

  2. Initial state
  
  If `init_from_file` in namelist is `.FALSE.`, all state variables are set to 0.
  
  Otherwise, initial values are read in the file named after the entry `init_state` in the namelist. The format is:
    - First line: initial velocity w
    - Line 2 to nl+1: index j, temperature t(j), salinity s(j)

  3. Forcing input
  
  Forcing parameters are read in the namelist and they are kept constant throughout the simulation.
  * tau    : applied torque
  * ref\_t : Reference temperature for relaxation (relaxed toward +ref\_t at source, and -ref\_t at sink)
  * xi\_t  : Temperature relaxation parameter
  * F\_s   : Magnitude of fixed salinity flux (+F\_s applied at source and -F\_s applied at sink)


## Matlab tools

Matlab tools are provided to:
* compute equilibrium tracer distribution when fixed-flux or relaxation forcings are applied: `loop_tracer_fixed.m` and `loop_tracer_relax.m`
* compute equilibrium state of the loop model with a semi-analytical value: `loop_equilibrium.m`
* analyze the linear stability of steady-states: `loop_jacobian.m`
* generate an initial-state file for the loop model: `loop_init_state.m`
* read model outputs in Matlab: `loop_read_out.m`

An example of use of Matlab tools is provided in the script `loop_test.m`
