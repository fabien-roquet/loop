## Matlab tools

Matlab tools are provided to:
* compute equilibrium tracer distribution when fixed-flux or relaxation forcings are applied: `loop_tracer_fixed.m` and `loop_tracer_relax.m`
* compute equilibrium state of the loop model with a semi-analytical value: `loop_equilibrium.m`
* analyze the linear stability of steady-states: `loop_jacobian.m`
* generate an initial-state file for the loop model: `loop_init_state.m`
* read model outputs in Matlab: `loop_read_out.m`

An example of use of Matlab tools is provided in the script `loop_test.m`
